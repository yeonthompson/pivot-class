        <p>My software development journey began when I was choosing what degree I wanted to complete in school. I have a bachelor's degree in Finance but realized technology is where my heart is. When researching the potential transition and what degrees were offered, I came across a program at UAB called the Masters of Management Information Systems Bridge Program.</p>
        <p>In that program one could take a few transitional courses to ensure that one's knowledge was up to par before going into the master's program. When starting the program, I decided to go online to see what else I should be learning. I came across a free course from Harvard called CS50: Introduction to Computer Science. I got a third of the way through the course when I started the bridge program and stopped because the work load was quite heavy between the two programs. However, that CS50 course partially made me realize that programming was what I wanted to do.</p>
        <p>I am currently in the final class of the bridge program. I realized during my python class that I really like to code. I found out about Pivot Technology School and knew that it was my best move during my transition to tech. There are some skills that I knew Pivot would be able to teach me. Those include:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>HTML</dt>
            <dd>I wanted to learn how websites are built. I knew HTML was the first step</dd>
            <dt>CSS</dt>
            <dd>Styling is important because you want the UX to make people want to come back to the product. That was a no brainer.</dd>
            <dt>JavaScript</dt>
            <dd>I knew JavaScript is a programming language like Python, but probably even better since anything that could be written in JavaScript probably will be in the future. This is a must for me to learn.</dd>
            <dt>Teamwork</dt>
            <dd>I know that software developers usually work as part of a team. It is important to be someone that people will want to work with. I am hoping that Pivot will teach me how to be the type of developer that people would want to collaborate with.</dd>
            <dt>Wisdom</dt>
            <dd>There is a great deal to learn from people who have been where you want to be. Going to them for help or advice is one of the best ways to ensure you improve. I went to Pivot because I know that someone there has been where I want to be. I want to learn the tricks of the trade, the unspoken rules if you will. Knowledge is knowing a tomato is a fruit. Wisdom is knowing not to put it in a fruit salad. I don't just want to learn the things above; I want to also learn how to most effectively apply the things I learn.</dd>
