        <p>I currently work in finance as a financial relationship consulatant. I make sure that people at the bank have the right products to meet their needs. </p>
        <p>One of my hobbies is working on my cars. You could say that I am a grease monkey. I like getting under my car and fixing(breaking) things. Another hobby of mine is learning. I love learning, especially right now since I really want to learn web development. I spend at least 2 hours a day reading/watching videos/getting hands on coding time. Another hobby includes gaming. If I am not working, studying, hanging with the wife, or working on cars I am probably gaming.</p>
        <p>I don't have a favorite sports team. I really don't follow sports. I really enjoy showing up to sporting events, downing like 33 beers, and cheering for the team that my friends are not cheering for.</p>
        <p>My favorite food is a tough one. I <strong>REALLY</strong> like food. Birria tacos are probably one of my most favorite. Followed by street tacos. I guess tacos are my favorite food. </p>
