            <h4>Dion</h4>             
            <p>Dion Davis was born and raised in Nashville, TN. Ready to get up out this state, but i'm stuck here for now. I don't like to talk about myself,so right now as i'm typing this I feel like i'm being tortured. It's okay though, I'll survive this.</p>

            <p>This is my second paragraph. I still don't know what to say, so i'm just typing. I'm typing because that's what i'm supposed to be doing right now and now typing this is becoming fun. Unfortunately the second paragraph is now over. </p>

            <p>Dust all up in the keyboard I've been typing so much. 2 hours of coding/learning everyday is how I improve. Teamates calling out tags like no ones business.</p>
